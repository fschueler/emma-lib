 * Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)

 * The root ensures that RMSE is measures on the same scale (and in the same units) as the target variable.
 * This error function is usually used for evaluation and therefore we don't provide the gradient. For trainig
 * the regular MSE works just as well.
 *
 * loss:      E(w) = sqrt { MSE }
